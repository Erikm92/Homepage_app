Home Page Application 

Application was built for the purpose of learning Django. 
It was hosted using PythonAnywhere

Originally the application was web scraping data from Wallstreet journal website for personal use.
Had to remove this due to using a free host with Pythonanywhere. code is still included.

What the application does?
It was built for creating a personal to do list. Using SQlite due to the simple nature of the todo list.

Allows user to update and delete from the todo list.

Application also includes a api for tracking weather from the current location.
